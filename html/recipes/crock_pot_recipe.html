        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Crockpot meals are an iconic piece of life in the midwest. You see, we're lazy so being able to just dump a
            bunch of anything into a pot and turn that sucker on low-medium heat for a few hours is way to appealing to 
            not take advantage of! The crock pot recipe we'll be focusing on now is chicken based but feel free to make
            it your own.
