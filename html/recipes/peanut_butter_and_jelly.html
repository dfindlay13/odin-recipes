        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The peanut butter jelly sandwich is an iconic food containing peanut butter, jelly, bread, and if your 
            into it some honey for sweetness! This iconic dish has served me as a quick pick me up whenever I'm down,
            or simply when you have nothing left in the cupboard - it always satisfies.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Bread - 2 pieces</li>
            <li>Peanut butter</li>
            <li>Jelly</li>
            <li>Honey (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Get two pieces of bread from the cupboard and place them on the plate separately</li>
            <li>Take a butter knife and spread an appropriate amount of peanut butter on one slice of 
                bread</li>
            <li>Now take the butter knife and spread an appropriate amount of jelly on the other bread</li>
            <li>(Optional) drip some honey onto the slice of bread with peanut butter on it</li>
            <li>Join the two pieces of bread together appropriately so you don't get your fingers messy!</li>
            <li>Enjoy! Or... cut it in half if you're psychotic and then enjoy</li>
        </ol>
