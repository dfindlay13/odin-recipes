# Recipes - Odin Project

## Executive Summary

This repo holds the recipes project conducted during the odin project. Through accomplishing this project I will put everything that I've learned
from the HTML section of the course into practice! 

## Methods and Skills used
- HTML boilerplate
- HTML Elements
  - Lists
  - Headers
  - Paragraphs
  - Links and Images
- Project file systems and directories
- Git familiarity 

## Reflection
This project took about 2 hours of work to get through the finish line. Everything that was applied was fairly easy to put into practice after learning it. There wasn't anything I really struggled with but did do some additional research as needed - such as figuring out the use cases for using a _self vs. _blank target in a link. Yes my website isn't the prettiest or fanciest. It doesn't have any interactive elements or styling but that wasn't the intent to begin with. Excited to have completed my first mini project and learn the basics of a new skill!

## Next Steps
Learn CSS and add some styling to this site!
